# ECG_Authentication

## Data Acquisition
>Data acquisition module aims to obtain raw biometric signals, either obtained from wearable devices or directly acquired from available public datasets [^1].

To obtain raw ECG signal, we used a [DFRobot's Gravity series of heart rate sensor](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Heart_Rate_Monitor_Sensor_SKU__SEN0213) and [Arudino Uno](https://www.switch-science.com/catalog/789/). You can get the code [here](https://github.com/Rvoiiima/research-lib/blob/main/serial-to-csv.py) to read serial data and save as csv file with Python.
